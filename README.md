# LiDAR-Data-Processing-open3d
This code processes (filtering, segmenting, clustering, ...) LiDAR point cloud data using "open3d" library in Python.
It reads .bin file and processes the data in a point-cloud format. It is tested with the raw data available at KITTI.
For practice, synced+rectified data from "2011_09_26_drive_0002" may be downloaded. In order to run the code, changes to the input path and output path should be made accordingly.
