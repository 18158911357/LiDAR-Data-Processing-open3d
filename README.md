# LiDAR-Data-Processing-open3d
This code processes (filtering, segmenting, clustering, ...) LiDAR point cloud data using "open3d" library in Python.

It reads .bin file and processes the data in a point-cloud format.
It is tested with the raw data available at [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php).

For practice, [synced+rectified data](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/avg-kitti/raw_data/2011_09_26_drive_0002/2011_09_26_drive_0002_sync.zip) from "2011_09_26_drive_0002" may be downloaded. In order to run the code, changes to the input path and output path should be made accordingly.
